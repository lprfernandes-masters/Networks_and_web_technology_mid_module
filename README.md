# CSCK543: Networks and web technology (KOL) - Mid Module Assignment

# Introduction

This is an individual coursework, and no part of this coursework is to be attempted as a group or with the aid of third parties.
<br>
<br>
This coursework requires you to develop a small website about topic of your choice.
<br>
<br>
You will be provided with some design constraints, but the remainder of any design considerations are up to you.
<br>
<br>
You are NOT allowed to make use of any other code libraries from any other source in your development. Your website will be assessed via Windows and a recent version of the Google Chrome web browser, but must be tested on different browsers.

# Task To Do

Create a small website containing 2 web pages. The website can be on a topic of your choice. Topics might include:

- a hobby or interest.
- favourite places to go.
- your favourite football team.

## Page 1:

Will be landing webpage of your website with appropriate name and links to other pages. Add a section on the right side of page showing images/scenes relevant to your selected topic (e.g., visiting places, football teams etc.,). You are allowed to include some text, if you wish.

## Page 2:

Must contain at least a textual, video and audio description of your selected topic. For example, a short ‘History’ or ‘Explanation’ in a paragraph along with a video and audio clips about your selected topic. Video/audio should not exceed more than 1 minute. There should be a link to next/previous page and some additional links for external websites (e.g., visiting places in that city etc.).

# You should

Style your website using a single external stylesheet. Do not create a separate stylesheet for each page. Your stylesheet must include styles for layout and formatting. Your page layout should, as a minimum, consist of a header, navigation menu, main content area and footer, all nested within an outer container.

- HTML5 must be used to code the content pages.
- NOT use JavaScript
- Include links to a couple of relevant external websites (e.g., links for visiting places in a selected city).
- Create a menu for internal navigation of your site. Your navigation menu must be implemented using a styled HTML list.
- Add appropriate and concise comments within the code of your HTML pages and your CSS document, to show that you understand your code.
- Implement features to address usability and accessibility.
- Your website should adapt well to different viewport sizes. This can be through good use of percentage widths and floats, or through the implementation of media queries.
